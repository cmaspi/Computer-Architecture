# Question-2
```asm
li rd, immediate
```

`x5`$\equiv$ `t0`

### a
```asm
li t0, -1
```      
The equivalent disassembled code is     
```asm
addi x5 x0 -1
```     
This occurs because we want to load `-1` to `t0`. `t0` is  ABI name for `x5`. We want to load -1 to `x5`. This can be converted to `addi` operation. Since `x0` always contains 0 we can translate the given instruction to `addi x5 x0 -1`

### b
```asm
li t0, 0xFFFFFFFF
```
The equivalent disassembled code is     
```asm
addi x5 x0 -1
```     
This is because `0xFFFFFFFF` is a 32 bit integer for `-1`. Since, `li` takes either 32 bit or 16 bit signed integers, we are given 32 bit integer which represents `-1`. We want to load -1 to `x5`. This can be converted to `addi` operation. Since `x0` always contains 0 we can translate the given instruction to `addi x5 x0 -1`

### c
```asm
li t0, 223
```

The equivalent disassembled code is     
```asm
addi x5 x0 223
```
This is because 223 lies in the range $-2^{11}$ to $2^{11}-1$. It can be directly written as `addi x5 x0 223` since `x0` always gives `0`

### d
```asm
li    t0, 1234
```

The equivalent disassembled code is 
```asm
addi x5 x0 1234
```
This is because 1234 lies in the range $-2^{11}$ to $2^{11}-1$. It can be directly written as `addi x5 x0 223` since `x0` always gives `0`

### e
```asm
li t0, 0x123456000
```

The equivalent disassembled code is
```asm
lui x5 0x92
addiw x5 x5 -1493
slli x5 x5 13
```

Let us understand is line by line.      
1. `lui x5 0x93`        
This loads 0x93000 in x5. `lui` appends 12 bits (0s) to the end. The Value in x5 after this operation is 598016                
2. `addiw x5 x5 -1493`      
addiw takes 12 bit immediate and adds it to 32 bit `rs1` (x5) and writes it into rd (x5). The Value in x5 after this operation is 596523         
3. `slli x5 x5 13`      
This left shits the value in `x5` by 13. `x5 = x5 << 13`. The Value in x5 after this operation is 4886716416 which is `0x0000000123456000` in hex.   

# Problem-3
1. `lui x1, 0x10000`        
Loads the given memory address in `x1`
2. `lhu x3, 0(x1)`      
`lhu` loads the unsigned halfword (16 bits) into `x3`. Since the memory address at x1 is `0x39933939a55aa5a5`. We load the first 16 bits, which are `a5a5`. Thus, the value at `x3` after this operation is `0x000000000000a5a5`
3. `lh x3, 0(x1)`   
`lh` loads the signed halfword (16 bits) into `x3`. Since the memory at x1 is `0x39933939a55aa5a5`. We load the first 16 bits, which are `a5a5`. Since `a5a5` in binary is `1010010110100101`. after the sign extension we get `0xffffffffffffa5a5` because `a5a5` has a negative sign.
4. `lh x3, 2(x1)`       
`lh` loads the signed halfword (16 bits) into `x3`. Since the memory at x1 (16 bits only) after offset of 2 bytes is `0xa55a` which also has a negative sign. After sign extension, we get `0xffffffffffffa55a` in `x3`
5. `ld x3, 0(x1)`       
`ld` loads the doubleword from the memory address at x1. So, we get `0x39933939a55aa5a5` into `x3`.
6. `ld x3, 4(x1)`
`ld` loads the doubleword from the memory address at x1 with offset 4 bytes, that is from `0x10000004`. So, we get `0x3993393939933939` into `x3`.
7. `lbu x3, 7(x1)`      
`lbu` loads 1 byte (unsigned) from memory address at x1 after offset of 7 bytes, that is `0x10000007`. So, we get `0x0000000000000039` into `x3`.
8. `lb x3, 7(x1)`
`lb` loads 1 byte (signed) from memory address at x1 after offset of 7 bytes, that is `0x10000007`. Sine the value is `0x39` the sign is positive (0 at most significant bit), after the sign extension we get `0x0000000000000039` into `x3`.
9. `lb x3, 6(x1)`
`lb` loads 1 byte (signed) from memory address at x1 after offset of 7 bytes, that is `0x10000007`. Sine the value is `0x93` the sign is negative (1 at most significant bit), after the sign extension we get `0xffffffffffffff93` into `x3`.
